# AI-Powered Students Project Management System

## Project Overview

### Project Title

Design and Implementation of an AI-Powered Students Project Management
System for Computer Science

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 1. Project Description

This project focuses on building a desktop-based system used only by
supervisors to manage, review, and control student projects.\
The system uses Artificial Intelligence to reduce topic duplication,
improve project quality, and make supervision easier.

Supervisors upload project documents, while the system automatically: -
Extracts key details - Checks for similar projects - Provides
expert-style feedback

The application serves as a central **project quality control system**
for the department.

## 2. Project Objectives

-   Reduce duplication of student project topics\
-   Support supervisors with AI-based project review\
-   Create a structured digital archive of projects\
-   Improve originality and academic quality\
-   Simplify supervision and record keeping

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. System Scope

-   Supervisor-only application\
-   No student-facing interface\
